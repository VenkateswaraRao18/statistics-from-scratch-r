Why Does Uncertainty Exist?", " 4 1. Why Does Uncertainty Exist? Every day we make decisions without knowing the future. Will tomorrow’s sales increase? Will it rain? Will a patient recover? Will a machine fail? The world is not deterministic. It contains variation, uncertainty, and randomness. Even if we repeat the same action twice, results can differ. For example: Two students study equal hours but score differently. A marketing campaign works in one city but fails in another. A model performs well on training data but poorly on new data. This variability is the starting point of statistics. Statistics exists because the world is not perfectly predictable. "],["what-is-data.html", "5 2. What Is Data?", " 5 2. What Is Data? Data is recorded information about the world. It can represent: Sales numbers Heights of students Temperature readings Website clicks Medical test results But raw data alone has no meaning. Consider this vector: sales &lt;- c(120, 135, 150, 98, 175, 142) sales ## [1] 120 135 150 98 175 142 These are just numbers. Without context, they tell us nothing. Statistics gives structure and meaning to data. "],["why-raw-data-is-not-enough.html", "6 3. Why Raw Data Is Not Enough", " 6 3. Why Raw Data Is Not Enough Imagine you are a business manager. You receive 10,000 rows of customer transaction data. What do you want to know? Average purchase amount Most common product category Seasonal trends Whether marketing increased revenue Raw data does not answer these. We need methods to: Summarize Analyze Interpret Draw conclusions That system of methods is statistics. "],["what-is-statistics.html", "7 4. What Is Statistics?", " 7 4. What Is Statistics? Statistics is the science of learning from data. More formally: It is the discipline concerned with collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data to make decisions under uncertainty. Statistics has two main branches: Descriptive Statistics Inferential Statistics "],["descriptive-vs-inferential-statistics.html", "8 5. Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics 8.1 5.1 Descriptive Statistics 8.2 5.2 Inferential Statistics", " 8 5. Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics 8.1 5.1 Descriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics summarizes data. Examples: Mean (average) Median Standard deviation Charts and graphs Example in R: mean(sales) ## [1] 136.6667 sd(sales) ## [1] 26.27293 These numbers describe only the data we have. They do not generalize beyond it. 8.2 5.2 Inferential Statistics Inferential statistics goes further. It asks: “If this sample looks like this, what can we say about the whole population?” Example: We survey 200 customers. Can we say something about all 50,000 customers? Inferential statistics allows us to: Estimate unknown quantities Test hypotheses Measure uncertainty Build predictive models This is where probability becomes important.

Population vs Sample Suppose an e-commerce company has: 1,000,000 customers (population) We survey: 2,000 customers (sample) Why not ask all 1,000,000? Because: It is expensive It is slow It may be impractical Statistics allows us to use samples to understand populations. This idea is the foundation of modern data science.

"],["statistics-vs-probability.html", "11 8. Statistics vs Probability", " 11 8. Statistics vs Probability These two are closely related but different. Probability: - Starts with a known model - Predicts outcomes Statistics: - Starts with data - Infers the model Example: Probability: “What is the chance of getting heads?” Statistics: “Based on 100 flips, is this coin biased?” Probability moves forward. Statistics moves backward. Machine learning combines both. "],["case-study-online-retail-company.html", "12 9. Case Study: Online Retail Company", " 12 9.
